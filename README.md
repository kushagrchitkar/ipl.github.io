# Alternate Repository for pitch-perfect.github.io

This repository serves as an alternate version of the official course project website (pitch-perfect.github.io). Due to restrictions on changes past the submission deadline for the official project, I have taken on the role of the sole maintainer for this alternate repository. Here, updates and optimizations will be applied regularly to enhance the overall user experience.

## Link to Website

https://kushagrchitkar.github.io/ipl.github.io/

## Optimizations 

1. **Video Compression:**
   - The original website had an abundance of video backgrounds, impacting load times. I have compressed each video, significantly improving the website's performance.

2. **CSS Tailored for MacBook/Linux Laptops:**
   - Current CSS effects are customized for MacBook or Linux laptops. Future updates will involve adopting a more universal CSS approach for a broader range of devices.

3. **Font Enhancement for Smartphones:**
   - The existing font poses readability issues on smartphones. A forthcoming update will introduce a different font optimized for small-screen devices.

## How to Contribute

Contributions to this alternate repository are welcome. Feel free to submit pull requests, report issues, or suggest improvements. Together, we can enhance the website's functionality and accessibility.

## Future Updates

Upcoming updates include:
- Implementing a universal CSS style to ensure compatibility with various devices.
- Incorporating a smartphone-friendly font for improved readability.

Thank you for your interest in the alternate repository. Your contributions and feedback are valued as we work towards creating an optimized and user-friendly version of the pitch-perfect.github.io website.
